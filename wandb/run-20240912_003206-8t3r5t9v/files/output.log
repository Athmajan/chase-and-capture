/Users/athmajanvivekananthan/WCE/JEPA - MARL/multi-agent/iDQN/bert_5050_mode11/bertsekas-marl/testlog.py:17: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
